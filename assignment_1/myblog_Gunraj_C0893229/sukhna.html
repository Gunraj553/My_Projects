                        Created in 1958 by damming the Sukhna Choe stream, the lake covers an area of approximately 3
                        square kilometers, making it a prominent landmark in the city. Surrounded by lush greenery and
                        scenic hills, Sukhna Lake offers a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of urban life. The
